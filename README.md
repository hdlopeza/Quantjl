# README

Code written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) for Computational Finance.

I'm writing it in `Julia`, rather than `R`, `MATLAB` or `Python`,
as a way to force myself to learn `Julia` and study for
the [FRM](http://www.garp.org/frm/frm-program.aspx)

## Influences
The code is heavily influenced by:
- [FinCal (R package)](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FinCal/index.html).
- [Quantifa (F# project)](http://sourceforge.net/projects/quantifa/).
- [C++ programs for Finance](http://finance.bi.no/~bernt/gcc_prog/)
- Etc.

## Tests
The tests in `test.jl` were culled from different sources:
- The R FinCal package
- The Quantifa project
- [Stocks and Bonds: Risks and Returns](https://class.stanford.edu/courses/GSB/StocksBonds/SelfPaced/about)
- [Financial Engineering and Risk Management Part I](https://www.coursera.org/course/fe1)
- Etc.
