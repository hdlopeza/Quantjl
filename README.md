# README

Code written in [Julia](http://julialang.org/) for Computational Finance.

I'm writing it in `Julia`, rather than `R`, `MATLAB` or `Python`,
as a way to force myself to learn `Julia` and study for
the [FRM](http://www.garp.org/frm/frm-program.aspx)

## Influences
The code is heavily influenced by:
- FinCal (R package).
- Quantifa (F# project).
- Etc.

## Tests
The tests in `test.jl` were culled from different sources:
- The R FinCal package
- The Quantifa project
- Several online classes
- Etc
